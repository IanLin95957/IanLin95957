      <p>In the last months of the Great War, the Americans join the fighting on the Western Front in an <br>effort to break through the German Lines for once and for all. The Americans launch their Meuse-<br>Argonne Offensive in the fall of 1918. As part of the offensive, nine companies of the United States <br>77th Division under command of Major Charles White Whittlesey pushes through the German lines <br>with remarkable ease. Little did they know that the German lines were not abandoned, but that they <br>simply found a hole. The Lost Battalion was surrounded and the men had to fight for days, awaiting <br>their rescue. </p>
